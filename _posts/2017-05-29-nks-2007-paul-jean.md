# Rule 146

Rule 146 looks like a fairly typical class 3 rule.

From a simple initial condition, it has the same nested pattern as rule 90.

From a random initial, it looks quite random.

# Monoliths

But for certain types of initial conditions, there is a surprising effect where very large triangles suddenly appear.  

I first noticed this at the 2004 NKS Summer School, and nicknamed them "monoliths".  

My purpose in this talk is to explore these monoliths and to try to understand why they appear.

# Triangles

All triangles are caused by a region being set to zero, after which the zero region gets progressively eaten away on the left and right until it disappears.

# Density

Normally, the density of blacks at each step hovers around 0.26 with a standard deviation of about 0.02.  This might be thought of as the "equilibrium" behavior of rule 146.

But when monoliths form, the density of blacks at each step drops to about 0.20, with huge fluctuations raising the standard deviation to about 0.05.

# Dependence on System Width

# Rule 146 and Rule 90

It turns out that if you look at the rule table of rule 146, it is related to rule 90.

Rule 90 takes the sum of the left and right cell mod 2.  Compare it to rule 146:

![nks-2007-paul-jean_21.gif](../../../assets/2017/05/29/nks-2007-paul-jean-500px/nks-2007-paul-jean_21.gif)

Rule 146 has the same output as long as there are no two blacks next to each other:

# Rule 146 and Rule 90

Now it makes sense why rule 146 looks just like rule 90 from a single black cell initial.  

Since the initial condition has no two black cells in a row, 146 does just what rule 90 does on the first step.  

And since rule 90 doesn't ever generate pairs of blacks from a single black cell, 146 mimics 90 on all subsequent steps.

# When 90 and 146 Are Different

But as soon as you cause a collision between two blacks, 90 and 146 do different things.

Notice that when there are an odd number of whites between the two blacks in the initial, 90 never generates two adjacent blacks.

So as long as blacks are separated by an odd number of whites in the initial, 146 just behaves like rule 90.

# Survey of Initials

This figure compares 90 and 146 for the first 32 initial conditions of width 8.

For each box, the first row is rule 90, the second is rule 146, and the third is the difference between the two.

The left column shows result for a fixed width of 8 (periodic boundaries), and the right column shows the same initial on a background of zero (infinite boundaries).

Whenever the initial has blacks separated by only an odd number of whites, the difference between the two evolutions is zero everywhere, regardless of boundary type.

# Two lattices in Rule 90

# Two lattices in Rule 90

We show the two lattices separately by taking every other cell.

Here I'm showing rule 90 on the left, and the two parities separated out on the right.

# Two lattices in Monoliths Rule 146

This is how the two phases look when a monolith is created.

This is as far as I've gotten in understanding monoliths.
