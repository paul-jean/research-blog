# Monoliths in ECA rule 146: new insights

I first noticed the appearance of exceptionally large triangles in the evolution of ECA rule 146 from certain types of initial conditions during the 2004 NKS Summer School.  I nicknamed these larger than average triangles "monoliths".  I have continued to study monoliths [1,2] as examples of large-scale collective phenomena (comparable to the system size) appearing suddenly within a system that seems to be in equilibrium.  

In this talk I will describe recent results suggesting that monoliths may be viewed in the context of annihilation events in additive ECA rule 90, with which rule 146 shares many characteristics.
