Universality results in simple programs capable of complicated behavior 

have traditionally relied on localized structures (\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]particles\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) well 

separated by relatively uniform regions.  This means a measures like the 

entropy of the system tends to be well below its theoretical maximum.  

But we suspect that this is a convenience, making it easier for humans 

to follow the steps of a universality proof, while just as much real 

computational work is being performed by the system\[CloseCurlyQuote]s evolution as in 

more separated, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]particle-like\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] behavior.

The open problem is thus to prove computational universality in a simple 

program system for which an entropy measure on each time step remains 

near its maximum - to be concrete, say over 80% of its maximum 

theoretical value on at least 80% of its time steps.  Can a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hot system\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] 

of this sort perform meaningful computations?
