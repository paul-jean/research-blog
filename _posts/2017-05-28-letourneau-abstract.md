Elementary Cellular Automata with Memory

Oral presentation

A simple modification of an Elementary Cellular Automaton will be presented, in which the centre cell of the three-cell neighborhood is referenced from a number of time steps in the past.  Two different emulations in terms of range-1 CAs will be described.  Analytical results for the bounds on finite growth rates and diffusion constants will also be given.  Exact results and mean-field approximations will be presented for statistical mechanical behavior, in particular discrete dynamical density maps, correlation functions, the growth of perturbations, and phase transitions.
